1) Because heap is a complete binary tree
2) using two separate arrays one for priority and one for data
3) if smaller is swapped then the larger child has priority

6) each node in a binary tree can only have at most 2 childred but in a b tree it can have more
7) 400, 200, 401, 201
8) 1,000,999 - 2,000,999

11) Allows a sub-tree to temp hold one too many entries. it is fixed by spliting the node and move nodes respectivly
14) 5, 3, 2, 2, 0, 2
15) the height is no more then logM n, where M is the MINIMUM
16) 


General Tree:
Each node can have infinite children or nodes.

Binary Tree:
Each node can only have up to 2 childred

Binary Search Tree:
The left child of a node must be less then or equal to the parent and the right child must be greater then or equal to the parent

Heaps:
Can be slow but it is very flexible with memory

B-Trees:
Everything has data pointers
